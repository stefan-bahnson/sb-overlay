    <h1>This is me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm an ambitious man of 37 years with 2 kids,<br/>
      Elina (10) and Filip (8).
    </p>
    <p>
      I live with my beautiful partner Lena who's currently studying to become a web developer.<br/>
      As you can imagine, we have many hot tempered discussions around this shared interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Code is one of my biggest interest but not the only one. <br/>
      I've always played in a band and like going up on a stage and entertain a crowd.
      I mainly play the guitar but also play the piano and sing. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I want to learn Wall Running which is pretty intense. <br/>
      Basically it's jumping on a trampoline with your back against the matt close to a wall and,
      you guessed it, run on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to running on walls I recently took up Digital painting. <br/>
      I'm only one painting in but really enjoy the mindfulness it brings me.
    </p>
    <p>That's pretty much me.</p>
